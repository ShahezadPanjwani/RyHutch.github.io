<!-- Instructions -->
<div>
    <p><b>Prep and Cook Time:</b> 30 minutes, chilling time: about 1 hour</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h2>Crust</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-1/2 cups walnuts</li>
        <li>1-1/2 cups dates (Medjool dates work well)</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Filling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 green apples, such as Granny Smith, sliced</li>
        <li>juice of 1 lemon in 2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp allspice</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp ground clove</li>
        <li>2 TBS honey</li>
        <li>1/2 cup apple juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine walnuts and dates in food processor. Make sure you remove pits if dates have them and cut off end
            where stem was. Process until well mixed and ground, but not smooth (about 40 seconds). It should be a
            coarse texture when done. Press evenly into a 9-inch tart pan. Set in refrigerator while making the
            filling.</li>
        <li>Slice apples by cutting into quarters. Cut out core and slice crosswise in 1/4 inch thick slices. Put into
            lemon water while you finish cutting apples. Drain well in colander when done.</li>
        <li>Place apples in a large skillet with rest of the ingredients and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring
            frequently on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Remove apples with a slotted spoon from hot pan to a bowl and cool completely.</li>
        <li>Reduce liquid to about half the volume and then cool.</li>
        <li>Spread apples evenly over crust. Brush apple-juice syrup over apples. The tart can be served right away or
            it will keep in refrigerator until needed. Keep tart covered in refrigerator so it doesn't pick up moisture.
            Top with a little vanilla yogurt if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Introduction to Recipe Rating System Chart</h2>
    <p>
        In order to better help you identify recipes that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the calories
        they contain, we created a Recipe Rating System. This system allows us to highlight the recipes that are
        especially rich in particular nutrients. The following chart shows the nutrients for which 15-Minute Greek
        Garbanzo Bean Salad is either an excellent, very good, or good source (below the chart you will find a table
        that explains these qualifications). If a nutrient is not listed in the chart, it does not necessarily mean
        that the recipe doesn't contain it. It simply means that the nutrient is not provided in a sufficient amount
        or concentration to meet our rating criteria. (To view this recipe's in-depth nutritional profile that includes
        values for dozens of nutrients - not just the ones rated as excellent, very good, or good - please use the link
        below the chart.) To read this chart accurately, you'll need to glance back up to see the ingredients used in
        the recipe and the number of serving sizes provided by the recipe. Our nutrient ratings are based on a single
        serving. For example, if a recipe makes 4 servings, you would be receiving the nutrient amounts listed in the
        chart by eating 1/4th of the combined ingredients found in the recipe. Now, returning to the chart itself, you
        can look next to the nutrient name in order to find the nutrient amount it offers, the percent Daily Value (DV%)
        that this amount represents, the nutrient density that we calculated for this recipe and nutrient, and the
        rating we established in our rating system. For most of our nutrient ratings, we adopted the government
        standards for food labeling that are found in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "Reference Values for
        Nutrition Labeling." Read more background information and details of our rating system.
